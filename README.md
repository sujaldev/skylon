# SKYLON

Bringing python to the web. (idk y though)

## WHY?

I started with the idea in mind creating `electronjs for python.` \
At the time I didn't know about CEF Python.\
After going through the hell that is html and css specifications, \
and having realised about CEF Python's existence. This project is currently `aimless`!\
Except for the knowledge gains from this project.
